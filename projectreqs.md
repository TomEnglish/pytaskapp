Project

In VS Code, create a .py file and complete the following requirements:

User Interface (UI) and Storage Method:
    xBuild a simple Command Line Interface (CLI)
    xthat welcomes users and displays a menu with options to add, view, delete tasks, or quit the application.
    xThe tasks should be stored in a Python list
Core Features
    xAdd tasks
    xView tasks
    xDelete tasks
    xQuit the application
User Interaction
    x Use input() to capture user selections and ensure proper input validation to handle invalid choices.
Error Handling
Implement error handling using try, except, else, and finally blocks to catch errors
    xAlert the user if they provide invalid input
    xAlert the user if there are no tasks to view
    xAlert the user if they try to delete a task that doesn't exist
    xAlert the user if they select an option on the main menu that doesn't exist
Code Organization
    x Organize your code into functions to improve clarity and maintainability. 
    x Use descriptive function names and add comments/docstrings where necessary.
Testing and Debugging
    Thoroughly test your application, considering edge cases such as:
    empty lists - re-request input
    invalid input. - re-request input // what might be invlaid??
Submission Guidelines:
Ensure the code is ready to run and that all functionality, such as loops, conditionals, and functions, works as expected when executed. The goal is to have fully tested and functional code.
Create a GitHub repository to host your project. Add, commit, and push your code to it
    xCreate a README.md on the repository that gives information about your project and how to run/use it
Submit the repository link in Google Classroom.
